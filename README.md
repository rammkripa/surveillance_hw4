# Surveillance Aesthetics Assignment 4: Sound

## Airplane Mode

### Concept

As we embark on our journeys through the skies, we often believe that activating "airplane mode" disconnects us from the digital world and shields our privacy. However, this artwork, titled "Airplane Mode," invites users to explore the illusion of disconnection.

In this piece, the user will hear a familiar flight safety announcement while witnessing the experience of logging onto airplane WiFi, only to confront a cookie consent banner that limits their options and subtly tracks their online presence.

Clicking the toggle switch simulates activating "airplane mode" and reveals the hidden layers of surveillance that persist even at cruising altitude.

I was fascinated by the idea of using sound to convey a sense of place to the user. By hearing the announcement, they are immediately transported to a flight and hence believe they are about to disconnect from the world. However, they are actually being tracked.

If I had more time, I would include even more examples of these sorts of tracking practices from other airlines, perhaps into a collage of videos playing at the same time.
